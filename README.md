## What is mora?

mora is a distributed event scheduler capable of handling both recurring and one-off event dispatching.

## Why mora? 

I always faced myself with tasks that needed to perform some kind of action (sending an email, notify a client, process stuff) but in delayed manner. I would often use `cron` like libraries and tools to achieve this kind of tasks, but I don't like this kind of approach, to me it doesn't seem "scalable".
Mora tries to fill that gap in my life.

## How mora?

Look up the docs [here](./docs/index.md)

## When mora?

 mora is being developed by me in my very limited spare time, do not expect bi-weekly releases :)
